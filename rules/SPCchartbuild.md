# Rules for qualifying patient labels for Statistical Process Control (SPC) Charts

(weekly aggregate time series data)

See [Mohammed, Worthington & Woodall; Plotting basic control charts: tutorial notes for healthcare practitioners](https://qualitysafety.bmj.com/content/17/2/137) for mathematical background.

## About SPC Percentage Charts (p-charts)
A p-chart is a time series chart showing a percentage with three reference lines - a mean, and an upper (UCL) and lower control limit (LCL) which indicate that 99% of the data points fall within these two limits. SPC charts are used in Quality Improvement to view variation in a process over time and to assess whether changes that are made to processes during improvement initiatives are resulting in actual statistically meaningful improvements (rather than common cause variation).

# Constructing the charts

* Build y-axis depicting the variable in question (the performance indicator you are interested in)
* Build x-axis depicting time in days/weeks
* Default x-axis to show last 26 data points, slider to allow up to 112 data points
* Database to hold 164 data points to allow annual export (manual) of data from DBForge; older data than this can be automatically erased
* Data points [Label: standard data point = blue dots; trend = blue squares; shift = organge diamonds; outlier = red triangle]
* Build central line based on the mean of all data points [Label: red line]
* Build upper and lower control limits [Label: green hashed line] to the data 3 sigma (Ïƒ) above and below the mean

## Formulae for calculating process mean and control limits

n = sample size (e.g. all patients)
x = number of events we are interested in (e.g. patients on target)

Process mean:
$\bar{p} = \frac{\sum x_i}{\sum n_i}, i=1...n$

Sigma is a measure of the variation of a binomial distribution, calculated as the square root of the process mean x (1-process mean) / n

$\sigma = \sqrt{\bar{p}(1 - \bar{p}) / n_i}$

Upper and lower control limits are 3 sigma above and below the process mean, but can't be below 0% or above 100%

Upper control limit = $\bar{p} + 3 \sigma$ (capped at 100%)
Lower control limit = $\bar{p} - 3 \sigma$ (capped at 0%)



## Rules for detecting special cause variation, i.e. statistically meaningful variation in the process

## Rule 1 - SHIFT 

When an SPC chart shows at least 7 data points above or below the mean, denote as a shift using 7 orange diamonds  

## Rule 2 - TREND  

When an SPC chart shows at least 7 ascending or descending data points, denote as a trend using 7 blue squares  

## Rule 3- OUTLIER 

When an SPC chart shows any data point outside of the control limits, denote as an outlier using a red triangle  

Note: *Control limits are stepped as they reflect the change in sample size of each data point* 

## Mean recalculation
If 7 + 1 consecutive data points above or below the mean (=shift), then recalculate the mean from this 8th data point using those 8 data points (i.e. this point and the preceding 7), but visually depict a change in mean going forward from the 8th data point. 
If there has been no mean recalculation at the end of a three month period: (end defined as March 31st, June 30th, September 30th & December 31st), then automatically recalculate mean using the previous 13 data points, only visually display change in mean going forward on next data point
