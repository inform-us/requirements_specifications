# CAM-ICU Delirium 
Rules for CAM-ICU Metric

## EPIC
- general information about metric (e.g. location, components, group or summative score etc)
- metric output (e.g. numerical (integer / decimal), drop down, range selection, free text etc)
- Are there corresponding targets?

## EPIC Flowsheets
* ### ABC metric [ID XXXX for Group or summative score if applicable]
 - overall CAM-ICU- Row ID 3040104650
-  Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS)- Row ID 3040104644

## ELIGIBILITY 

- All patients who have had a RASS score of -3 to +4 (for at least 2 consecutive hours?) 

## VALIDITY
1) The CAM-ICU metric should be documented once per shift ie. once between 08:00-19:59 each day and once between 20:00-07:59 each day 
2) Every CAM-ICU score set between 08:00-19:59 is valid until either 20:00 hours. 
3) Every  CAM-ICU score set between 20:00-07:59 is valid until 08:00. 
4) Each CAM-ICU score therefore expires at 08:00 and 20:00 every day. 
5) Each documented CAM-ICU score can be superseded if an entry is updated or new entry is made during that shift, this will generate a new _dt stamp (more recent) and become the 'valid' entry

## CLASSIFICATION 

Go through each metric in sequence and which charts this data feeds into. 

**[A] CAM-ICU Percentage Completions This Shift Front Tile**
  - calculate the number of patients with a RASS score of -3 to +4 (*for at least two consecutive hours?*) this shift (since 08:00 hours or 20:00 hours today) 
- for each patient with a RASS score of -3 to +4 this shift, calculate the number who have at least one CAM-ICU score documented (positive or negative) this shift (since 08:00 hours or 20:00 hours today) 
- Numerator = number of patients with a RASS score of -3 to +4 who have had at least one CAM-ICU score documented since the beginning of this shift 
- Denominator = number of patients with a RASS score of -3 to +4 (*for at least two consecutive hours?*) this shift 
**[A] CAM-ICU Percentage Completions Last Shift Front Tile**
- calculate the number of patients with a RASS score of -3 to +4 (*for at least two consecutive hours?*) this shift (since 08:00 hours or 20:00 hours today) 
- for each patient with a RASS score of -3 to +4 this shift, calculate the number who have at least one CAM-ICU score documented (positive or negative) this shift (since 08:00 hours or 20:00 hours today) 
- Numerator = number of patients with a RASS score of -3 to +4 who have had at least one CAM-ICU score documented since the beginning of this shift 
- Denominator = number of patients with a RASS score of -3 to +4 (*for at least two consecutive hours?*) this shift 

E.G. Feeds into (i) front tile - 24 hour rolling window and (ii) SPC interval charts.

**[B]  overall CAM-ICU front tile calculation: Patients with Delirium in the last 24 hours**

- calculate the number of patients with a RASS score of -3 to +4 (*for at least two consecutive hours?*) in the last 24 hours
- calculate the number of patients with at least one positive CAM-ICU positive score in the last 24 hours 
-numerator: the number of patients with positive CAM-ICU scores in the last 24 hours 
-denominator: the number of patients with a RASS score of -3 to -4

# [E] SPC CHARTS 

**ABC SPC CHARTS (refer to XYZ metric in classification**

1. Calendar day defined as 00:00 - 23:59
2. Week defined as Monday 00:00 – Sunday 23:59
  
## Chart 1 [Patient chart] 
**Proportion of moderate or severe pain scores – weekly chart**

Operational definition = of the documented pain scores in EPIC, what proportion are moderate or severe on a weekly basis? 

   
**Chart 2**

1. These are weekly percentage (p-charts) SPC
2. Week defined a Monday 00:00 – Sunday 23:59
