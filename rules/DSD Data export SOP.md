# Accessing Tabular Data in the Data Science Desktop 

## Updated March 2024

DBForge is a programme for looking at databases

*Note There is a wiki about DB forge access called common tasks and how tos on the git hub repository. Lots of other common tasks too.*
*This is also on Read me on Repo uclvldddtaeps02.xuclh.nhs.uk*

* On the NHS desktops you need to start with citrix login which is on the bottom right hand corner of the screen. 
* Using the Data Science Desktop, on citrix, open dbForge Studio for PostgreSQL > Devart, DB Forge in the windows drop down
* IF 'trial period expired' message, select 'Use Express' and re-open dbForge
* Enter the database information when prompted using the following:


Host: UCLVLDDDTAEPS02
Port: 5432
User: Your EMAP username
Password: Your EMAP password
Database: uds
 
*note the `Test Connection` button shows whether you are able to successfully connect*
 
* After connection you may be met with another an optional update for dbForge - reply with 'Ask Later'
 
* You can now start viewing tabular data. This is possible via SQL query (New SQL tab at the top left) or graphically through the GUI. 
 
* For the GUI method - select the drop-down arrow next to the 'uds' entry in the panel at the top left of the screen > scroll down to the 'informus' entry > drop-down arrows next to 'informus' > 'Tables'. 

You should see something like
  
You can now view the data in any of these tables by double-clicking on the name of the table. For general browsing, please select 'read-only' when prompted, unless you intend to alter data within the tables.
Once the tables are loaded you are able to filter by any of the columns shown. More interesting/advanced queries can be performed by manually writing SQL queries via with 'New SQL' and 'Execute' buttons in the top left. Remember that our tables are 
in the 'informus' database - an example query to show all of the hourly spO2 data in descending order (by time written to the database) is given by
SELECT * FROM informus.oxygen ORDER BY log_dt DESC;
again, when prompted please select the 'read-only' view!

Instructions for using Tables in DB forge to investigate data
Inform_us is prod
Inform_us staging is staging
Note that the data that is being worked on in staging, will not be available in the tables.
Within these open tables and you will see all the data on each metric. 
Double click on a metric and you open up all the stored data we store daily. So this is processed, not raw EMAP data. 
You can sort the data by clicking on the metric heading at top, e.g. like excel. 
This will show 1000 rows per page
Flick between rows with arrows at the bottom of the table. 
Flick between pages of 1000 with the arrows at the top of the table. 
To filter â€“ you can filter by MRN or bay and by date etc to look at a specific subset of the data. 
For example to find a patient for a certain period of time go to data tab, quick filter, condition, then type the new mrn then click + and 

To export- right click on the table and export to CSV or other formats, click field seperator- comma, select colums you want (all), can choose a range of rows if you want. 
You can also highlight particular rows in the table and right click to export those rows. 
We could actually build run charts using these data. 

A data export should be done twice a year, in January and June for all metrics.
