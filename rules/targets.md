## TARGETS SET - Daily percentage of all targets set in ICU navigators 
Operational definition= what proportion of all patients have all their targets set in ICU navigators in EPIC by 1pm each day?  

1. Generate percentage of patients with all 8 (Spo2, MAP, RASS, pH, haemoglobin, fluid balance, paCO2, paO2) daily - i.e. add up number of patients with all targets set at 1pm and divide by number of patients on unit at that time 
2. Present as percentage
