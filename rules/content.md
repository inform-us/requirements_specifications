**What is this chart?**

This is a Statistical Process Control (SPC) percentage chart. SPC charts are graphs that are commonly used in healthcare improvement for looking at a process over time and determining whether anything changes.  

 
On this graph you will see a daily percentage of patients who had all their targets set by 13:00 hours (data points), the average percentage over time (red mean line), and the data process limits  (green hashed lines) which represent the boundary lines generated by the data, i.e. where we would expect most of the data to fall between. Note that process limts are not goal lines.  

 
Outliers, shifts and trends suggest there is a non-random change to the data. Why are we seeing this change? Could it be improvement or deterioation to the process?  

 
Means and process limits are recalculated once per quarter or after a shift.
