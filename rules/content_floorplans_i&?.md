Good pain management is an essential component of quality care. Pain in critical care and post-anasthetic care unit is common and contributes to poor patient outcomes.  

In CCU we assess pain using the Verbal Pain Scale (VPS) or Critical Care Observation Tool (CPOT) for patients who are unable to self-report their pain, e.g. under sedation.  

Pain assessment as per the critical care pain guidelines: 

* Assess 4-hourly for no/mild pain 

* Asses hourly for moderate/severe pain
  
* Reassess pain after interventions 

* If pain is difficult to manage ask for help and refer patient to the pain team 

* If patient is sleeping, but seems comfortable, you can select ‘unable to assess’ and write the reason. Sleep should be the only reason for selecting that pain is ‘unable to assess’.

**Eligibility**  

All patients 


**Classification**


* **Green:** Patient’s most recent pain score indicates none or mild pain (VPS = 0-1 or CPOT= 0-2) 

* **Amber:** Patient’s most recent pain score indicates moderate pain (VPS = 2 or CPOT= 3-4) 

* **Red:** Patient’s most recent pain score indicates severe or very severe pain (VPS = 3-4 or CPOT= 5-8) 

Amber and red scores are valid for 60 minutes (plus 15 minutes documentation leeway) or until a new score is documented. 

Green pain scores valid for 4 hours (plus 15 minutes documentation leeway) or until a new score is documented. 

These data update every five minutes.  


* **Tip 1:** If there has been more than one pain score documented across one hour, the most recent score will be used unless a) the most recent score was CPOT preceded by a VPS score, in which case the most recent VPS score will be use or b) the most recent score was VPS 'unable to assess' preceded by a VPS or CPOT, in which case the most recent VPS or CPOT will be used. This allows the dashboard to show the most recent pain score, which may have changed following an intervention.  

* **Tip 2:** If more than one score is documented at the same time, the highest score will be used. If the scores are equal, VPS will be used in preference to CPOT.  

* **Tip 3:** If a bed is dark grey, calculation cannot be completed 

* **Tip 4:**  Pain assessments recorded as “unable to assess” due to sleep will not show on the individual patient graph as this is not a pain score. This will appear greyed out (same as missing).  

* **Tip 5:**  A gap after a blue line on the individual patient charts reflects the 15-minute leeway added to the validity window of a score
