Good pain management is an essential component of quality care. Pain in critical care and post-anasthetic care unit is common and contributes to poor patient outcomes.  

In CCU we assess pain using the Verbal Pain Scale (VPS) or Critical Care Observation Tool (CPOT) for patients who are unable to self-report their pain, e.g. under sedation.  

Pain assessment as per the critical care pain guidelines: 

* Assess 4-hourly for no/mild pain 

* Asses hourly for moderate/severe pain
  
* Reassess pain after interventions 

* If pain is difficult to manage ask for help and refer patient to the pain team 

* If patient is sleeping, but seems comfortable, you can select ‘unable to assess’ and write the reason. Sleep should be the only reason for selecting that pain is ‘unable to assess’.
