# Airway Plan Rules
Rules for the Airway Plan Metric

## EPIC
Airway plan is completed in 'ICU Navigators' tab [doctors' log in view] and are displayed in 'Airway and Turning Plan' Tab.

The medical team should complete the airway plan at least once during the patient's admission to critical care.  If there are changes to the patient's airway status, then the airway plan should be updated.

ICU Airway Plan is a binary metric (a generic airway plan is either selected or not selected). If this flowsheet is not selected, then Airway plan A, B and C will be collected specifying a specific plan for the individual patient.

Inforum_us will display if the airway plan has been documented once during the patients admission.
