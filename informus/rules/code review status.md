# Code Review status 


✅ = done

❌ = not done (refer to the `Still to be done` column)

⚠️ = partial (refer to the `Still to be done` column)

# SPC metrics
For code review here, start with build code sign off, then move onto new SPC chart measurement interval charts, then binary e.g. targets and airway, then older metrics.
