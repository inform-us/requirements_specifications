# Epidural and Motor Block/Brommage Score Rules

## Rules for Epidural and the level of motor block that the epidural is providing to the patient

EPIC
Some patients will be given an epidural for pain management. While epidurals are effective, they also carry risk as they can cause
temporary paralysis (motor block) which if gone unnoticed for too long can have catastrophic implications including permanent paralysis.
It is therefore important for clinical staff to have an overview of who on the units is using an epidural for pain relief and what their 
level of motor block is in order to ensure patient safety. A patient with an epidural attached is a patient safety risk much like a patient
with a difficult airway. 

The epidural metric will be included on the pain tile and will not have its own tile. 
Whether a patient has an epidural will be denoted on the pain score floor plan. An additional tab floor plan will be added to display the motor block data. 
There are no individual patient charts for this metric

EPIC Flowsheets
Flowsheet	Row ID | Manual/Automatic/Calculated Input | Comments	| Expected documentation frequency
  |-|-|-|-|-|


ELIGIBILITY
All patients on all units. 
Note these patients will more frequently be found on the post-surgical units, T06 and PACU

VALIDITY
If a patient has been on an epidural in the last 4 hours, they are classified as 'on epidural'. If a patient is 'on epidural' they are required to have a 
motor block assessment documented: 2 hourly during the day shift (08:00-19:59), and 4 hourly during the night shift (20:00-07:59). 

CLASSIFICATION

[A] The epidural data on the front tile is a real time view of the number of patients who are currently on an epidural 
(at each refresh looks back and collect all the current epidural flowsheets)
Calculate the current number of patients who have had an epidural documented in the last four hours 
Present this number on the front tile as 'number of patients on epidural'. 

[A] ABC Measurement Interval (for motor block scoring only)

E.G. Feeds into (i) front tile - 24 hour rolling window and (ii) SPC interval charts.



## [C] Floorplan labelling 

ON EPIDURAL FLOOR PLAN

**Whether a patient is on an epidural for their pain management should be denoted on the existing pain score floor plan** 

1. If any of the epidural drug flowsheets have been documented in the last 4 hours, label patient as 'on epidural'
2. If none of the epidudral drug flowsheets have been documented in the last 4 hours, the patient is not on an epidural. No change. 

MOTOR BLOCK ASSESSMENT FLOOR PLAN

There will be an addtional floorplan button added to the pain floor plan entitled 'Motor Block Assessment'


Secondary label-
*we need to display whether a motor block assessment is overdue whilst at the same time displaying the last level of motor block assessed. This means that for this floor plan, 
there will be no stricly 'missing' beds, but when an assessment is missing, it will also display the last motor block assessment captured. 
If there has never been a motor block assessment completed during the patient's admission, then label patient as 'missing'. 
If the current time is 08:00-19:59, if 'motor block' flowsheet has not been completed in the last two hours, then label patient as 'missing' and forward fill the latest motor block asessmeent reading. 
Bed to be red hashed outline.
If the current time is 20:00-)7:59, if 'motor block' flowsheet has not been completed in the last four hours, then label patient as 'missing' and forward fill the latest motor block asessmeent reading.

Proportion of moderate or severe pain scores – weekly chart

Operational definition = of the documented pain scores in EPIC, what proportion are moderate or severe on a weekly basis?
