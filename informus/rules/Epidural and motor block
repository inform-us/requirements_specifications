# Epidural and Motor Block/Brommage Score Rules

## Rules for Epidural and the level of motor block that the epidural is providing to the patient

EPIC
Some patients will be given an epidural for pain management. While epidurals are effective, they also carry risk as they can cause
temporary paralysis (motor block) which if gone unnoticed for too long can have catastrophic implications including permanent paralysis.
It is therefore important for clinical staff to have an overview of who on the units is using an epidural for pain relief and what their 
level of motor block is in order to ensure patient safety. A patient with an epidural attached is a patient safety risk much like a patient
with a difficult airway. 

The epidural metric will be included on the pain tile and will not have its own tile. 
Whether a patient has an epidural will be denoted on the pain score floor plan. An additional tab floor plan will be added to display the motor block data. 
There are no individual patient charts for this metric

EPIC Flowsheets
Flowsheet	Row ID | Manual/Automatic/Calculated Input | Comments	| Expected documentation frequency
  |-|-|-|-|-|


ELIGIBILITY
All patients on all units. 
Note these patients will more frequently be found on the post-surgical units, T06 and PACU

VALIDITY
If a patient has been on an epidural in the last 4 hours, they are classified as 'on epidural'. If a patient is 'on epidural' they are required to have a 
motor block assessment documented: 2 hourly during the day shift (08:00-19:59), and 4 hourly during the night shift (20:00-07:59). 

CLASSIFICATION
Go through each metric in sequence and which charts this data feeds into.

[A] The epidural data on the front tile is a real time view of the number of patients who are currently on an epidural rolling window 
(at each refresh looks back and collect all the current epidural flowsheets)
Calculate the current number of patients who have had an epidural documented in the last four hours. 
Present this number on the front tile as 'number of patients on epidural' 

[A] ABC Measurement Interval

E.G. Feeds into (i) front tile - 24 hour rolling window and (ii) SPC interval charts.

[B] ABC metric front tile calculation

[C] Floorplan labelling
