#Epidural and Motor Block/Brommage Score Rules

Rules for Epidural and the level of motor block that the epidural is providing to the patient

EPIC
Some patients will be given an epidural for pain management. While epidurals are effective, they also carry risk as they can cause
temporary paralysis (motor block) which gone unnoticed for too long can have catastrophic immplications including permannet paralysis.
EPIC Flowsheets
Volume Infused (mL) Bupivacaine (0.1%)/Fentanyl (2 mcg /mL)	28222

ELIGIBILITY
All patients on all units. Note these patients will more frequently be found on the post-surgical units, T06 and PACU
VALIDITY
for XYZ calculation (e.g. 1 hour epoch) used for which part of user interface (e.g. floorplan, individual chart & SPC)
CLASSIFICATION
Go through each metric in sequence and which charts this data feeds into.

[A] ABC Measurement Interval

E.G. Feeds into (i) front tile - 24 hour rolling window and (ii) SPC interval charts.

[B] ABC metric front tile calculation

[C] Floorplan labelling

[D] Classification Rules: Individual patient chart

[E] SPC CHARTS
ABC SPC CHARTS (refer to XYZ metric in classification

Calendar day defined as 00:00 - 23:59
Week defined as Monday 00:00 – Sunday 23:59
Chart 1 [Patient chart]
Proportion of moderate or severe pain scores – weekly chart

Operational definition = of the documented pain scores in EPIC, what proportion are moderate or severe on a weekly basis?

Chart 2

These are weekly percentage (p-charts) SPC
Week defined a Monday 00:00 – Sunday 23:59
