# Epidural and Motor Block/Brommage Score Rules

## Rules for Epidural and the level of motor block that the epidural is providing to the patient

EPIC
Some patients will be given an epidural for pain management. While epidurals are effective, they also carry risk as they can cause
temporary paralysis (motor block) which if gone unnoticed for too long can have catastrophic implications including permanent paralysis.
It is therefore important for clinical staff to have an overview of who on the units is using an epidural for pain relief and what their 
level of motor block is in order to ensure patient safety. A patient with an epidural attached is a patient safety risk much like a patient
with a difficult airway. 

The epidural metric will be included on the pain tile and will not have its own tile. 
Whether a patient has an epidural will be denoted on the pain score floor plan. An additional tab floor plan will be added to display the motor block data. 
There are no individual patient charts for this metric

EPIC Flowsheets
Flowsheet	Row ID | Manual/Automatic/Calculated Input | Comments	| Expected documentation frequency
  |-|-|-|-|-|


ELIGIBILITY
All patients on all units. 
Note these patients will more frequently be found on the post-surgical units, T06 and PACU

VALIDITY
If a patient has been on an epidural in the last 4 hours, they are classified as 'on epidural'. If a patient is 'on epidural' they are required to have a 
motor block assessment documented: 2 hourly during the day shift (08:00-19:59), and 4 hourly during the night shift (20:00-07:59). 

CLASSIFICATION

[A] The epidural data on the front tile is a real time view of the number of patients who are currently on an epidural 
(at each refresh looks back and collect all the current epidural flowsheets)
Calculate the current number of patients who have had an epidural documented in the last four hours 
Present this number on the front tile as 'number of patients on epidural'. 

[A] ABC Measurement Interval

E.G. Feeds into (i) front tile - 24 hour rolling window and (ii) SPC interval charts.



**[C] Floorplan labelling - On Epidural**

**Whether a patient is on an epidural for their pain management should be denonted on the existing pain score floor plan** 

1. If any of the epididural latest verbal pain scale reading = 0-1: ‘GREEN’; design = green filled bed 
2. If latest CPOT reading = 0-2: ‘GREEN’; design = green filled bed
3. If latest verbal pain scale reading = 2: ‘AMBER’; design = amber filled bed
4. If latest CPOT reading = 3-4: ‘AMBER’; design = amber filled bed
5. If latest verbal pain scale reading = 3-4: ‘RED’; design = red filled bed
6. If latest CPOT reading = 5-8: ‘RED’; design = red filled bed
7. If latest reading ‘missing’: ‘missing’; design = white filled bed with red hashed outline
8. If latest VPS reading is ‘unable to assess’, label as ‘unable to assess’. Design = white filled bed with blue hashed outline.

[E] SPC CHARTS
ABC SPC CHARTS (refer to XYZ metric in classification

Calendar day defined as 00:00 - 23:59
Week defined as Monday 00:00 – Sunday 23:59
Chart 1 [Patient chart]
Proportion of moderate or severe pain scores – weekly chart

Operational definition = of the documented pain scores in EPIC, what proportion are moderate or severe on a weekly basis?

Chart 2

These are weekly percentage (p-charts) SPC
Week defined a Monday 00:00 – Sunday 23:59
