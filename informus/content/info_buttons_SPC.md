## i button


**What is this chart?**

This is a Statistical Process Control (SPC) percentage chart. SPC charts are graphs that are commonly used in healthcare improvement for looking at a process over time and determining whether anything changes.  
On this graph you will see a weekly percentage of patients who had all their targets set by 13:00 hours (data points), the average percentage over time (red mean line), and the data process limits  (green hashed lines) which represent the boundary lines generated by the data, i.e. where we would expect most of the data to fall between. Note that process limits are not goal lines.  
Outliers, shifts and trends suggest there is a non-random change to the data. Why are we seeing this change? Could it be improvement or deterioration to the process?  
Means and process limits are recalculated once per quarter or after a shift. 
Note that you can scroll back to view a maximum of 112 weeks of data. 

Means and process limits recalculate either after a sustained shift in the data OR every 6 months to reflect a more up-to-date process. 

The slider below the graph allows you to go forward and back in time. The maximum amount of retrospective data you can view is 112 weeks.

**Eligibility**

All patients in critical care. 

**Classification**

A patient is classified all ‘all targets set’ for the day if all 8 physiological targets have been set or ticket ‘not applicable’ in the ICU Targets section of the ICU Navigators. 


‘All targets set’ classification is valid from 08:00 hours the previous day (or more recent – e.g. if targets updated or new admission) until 13:00 hours on the current day. This allows period of time to set new targets each morning.

**About Mean Arterial Blood Pressure (MAP)**


 
Excessive use of vasoactive drugs is associated with poor outcomes, as is persistently low blood pressure.  
MAP targets have an upper and lower limit and therapy should be titrated to keep within range. 
These charts help us evaluate how well we are doing with keeping patients within their MAP target.  

## ? button

**Eligibility**
 
All patients in critical care on intravenous vasoactive drugs. 


**Classification**

Only hours within a calendar day where a patient is both on intravenous vasoactive drugs and has a MAP target set are included. 
A patient’s MAP target classification for the calendar day is based on the following criteria.  

**A patient is classified as either ‘above’ or ‘below’ if:** 

 
* The most frequent reading during the calendar day is either ‘above’ or ‘below’ target. 
 
* The most frequent reading is ‘in range’, but the patient is ‘in range’ for less than 50% of the calendar day, then the patient is classified as the second most frequent 
  reading (‘above’ or ‘below’). 

* The readings are equal between both ‘above’ and ‘below’, or all three: ‘in range’, ‘above’, and ‘below’, a patient’s calendar day is classified as ‘above’. 


A patient is classified as ‘in range’ if the most frequent reading is ‘in range’ AND they are ‘in range’ for greater than or equal to 50% of the eligible hours that day.

**About Tidal Volume**


Persistently exceeding a tidal volume of over 8ml/kg2 Ideal Body Weight is associated with harm and increased mortality.  
This chart helps us evaluate how well we are doing with keeping tidal volumes within range.  

 

## ? button 

 

**Eligibility**

 
All patients in critical care who are intubated/tracheotomised and on mandatory ventilation. To be eligible a patient needs to have been ventilated for at least four consecutive hours.  

 

**Classification**  


Only hours within a calendar day where a patient is intubated and receiving mandatory ventilation are included. 

A patient’s calendar day classification is determined by their most frequent tidal volume reading for the day (‘above’ or ‘in range’) of less than 8ml/kg IBW. 

If a patient’s tidal volume reading for the calendar day are equal (between ‘above’ and ‘in range’), then the calendar day designation is ‘above’. 

All calendar day designations are pooled into one week. A week if defined as Monday 00:00 – Sunday 23:59.

**About RASS**


The Richmond Agitation and Sedation Score (RASS) measures how sedated or agitated a patient is and can be used, in those undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation, to prevent over- or under-sedation.  
Excessive use of sedative drugs to support mechanical ventilation is associated with poor outcomes.  
This chart helps us evaluate how well we are doing with achieving RASS targets.  


## ? button 

 

**Eligibility**

All patients in critical care who are sedated, intubated and mechanically ventilated. To be eligible, a patient needs to have been ventilated or sedated for four consecutive hours. 


**Classification**


Only hours within a calendar day where a patient is sedated and mechanically ventilated are included.  

A patient’s calendar day classification is determined by their most frequent RASS (‘achieving target’ or ‘not achieving target’). 

If a patient’s RASS reading for the calendar day are equal (between ‘ achieving target’ and ‘not achieving target’), then the calendar day designation is ‘not achieving target’. 

All calendar day designations are pooled into one week. A week is defined as Monday 00:00 – Sunday 23:59.

Regular and systematic assessment of Sedation and Agitation is a crucial part of ICU care. 
RASS score should be documented hourly in the day and 4-hourly at night.  
These charts help us evaluate how well we are doing with assessing and documenting sedation and agitation as per our guidelines.  


## ? button 

 
**Eligibility**

All patients in critical care who are sedated, intubated and mechanically ventilated. To be eligible, a patient needs to have been ventilated or sedated for four consecutive hours. 


**Classification**

A weekly percentage of ‘on time’ RASS assessments is calculated using the number of RASS that are documented within documentation guidelines divided by the total number of expected assessments. Note that when patients are off unit for periods of time, e.g. for imaging or tests, this time will not be counted in this calculation. 

 
Within documentation guidelines:  

During the day, RASS score should be documented hourly in EPIC. 

During the night, RASS score should be documented every four hours. 

To account for excessively long periods where pain has not been assessed and documented, the denominator has been adjusted.

**Eligibility**

All patients in critical care. 

**Classification**

 
A daily percentage of scores that are moderate or severe is calculated using the number of documented moderate or severe scores, divided by the number of all documented pain scores.  


The weekly percentage of scores that are moderate or severe shown on this graph is the average of all daily percentages across the calendar week.  


A week is defined as Monday 00:00 – Sunday 23:59.  


Only documented numerical pain scores (VPS or CPOT) are included in the data. Non-numerical pain scores, e.g. ‘unable to assess’ are not included in this chart.

### About Motor Block Assessment

Epidurals are effective for pain relief, but they also carry risk of complications including haematoma (bleeding around the spine) which can cause permanent paralysis. 

All patients on an epidural infusion therefore need to have an assessment of their level of motor block (also referred to as Bromage Score) to their right and left leg 2 hourly in the day (08:00-19:59) and 4 hourly in the night (20:00-07:59). Once patient's epidural infusion has been stopped, motor block assessment must continue until 12 hours have passed or until there is no block (both right and left leg scores are zero), whichever comes first.


### ? button

Eligibility

All patients with epidural infusion running within the last 12 hours

Classification

During the day, motor block should be assessed every 2 hours in epic. Once the epidural infusion has been stopped, assessment should continue for 12 hours or until there is no block, whichever comes first. 

During the night, motor block should be assessed every 4 hours in epic. Once the epidural infusion has been stopped, assessment should continue  for 12 hours or until there is no block, whichever comes first. 

To account for excessively long periods where motor block has not been assessed and documented, the denominator has been adjusted.  

A day shift week is defined as Monday 08:15– Sunday 20:14

## About Airway Management

Airway management in critical care may be seen as a routine procedure for critically ill patients. Nevertheless, critical care patients are more prone to complications from airway management procedures, which may result in worse patient outcomes (such as death, brain damage and prolonged ICU stay).   

All patients should have airway plan's documented in epic during admission and airway plans should be reviewed every 14 days. 


## ? button

**Eligibility**

All patients across all units

**Classification**

A weekly percentage of all Critical Care inpatients who have had at least one airway plan documented in epic during there stay. Note that patients with admissions longer than one week will be recounted (in the percentage denominator) for each week of their stay, but once an airway plan is documented, it is valid for the rest of the admission. 


A night shift week is defined as Sunday 20:15 to Monday 08:14 

**Content for hyperlink ‘More about how to interpret SPC charts’**

## How do I interpret an SPC chart?


SPC charts allow you view a process over time and highlight any statistically significant changes. We use SPC so that we can see whether our performance on a quality metric is stable, to see whether any changes we make result in improvement, and to make sure our performance doesn’t deteriorate over time (or if it does to explore why).   


**SPC Chart Rules**
Here are some simple rules for interpreting SPC charts and therefore detecting whether variation in the data is common cause (expected) variation, which is not statistically significant OR  special cause variation, which suggests something real is happening in the process, such as improvement or deterioration. Common cause variation will always happen and shouldn’t trigger a response, but when we see special cause variation, we should be asking questions and having conversations.  

 

**Rule 1- an OUTLIER**
Variations in observations are common and expected, just because an observation is higher or lower on one day does not necessarily reflect a significant change. Most one-off data points falling within the process limits would be considered expected variation. However, if a data point falls outside of one of the process limits, this is an OUTLIER. This means that something unexpected has happened that is unlikely to be due to chance. If we spot an outlier we should be asking ‘what happened here that made our data differ significantly from what we expected?’ 

 

**Rule 2- A SHIFT**

If there are 7 points above or below the mean line, this suggests a statistically significant shift, in what we are doing (either for the better or for the worse). A sustained shift of 12 points that remain above or below the mean will recalculate a new mean and process limits.  

 

**Rule 3- A TREND**

If there are 7 or more points sequentially ascending or descending, this suggests a statistically significant trend in one direction.

Shifts or trends may be happening as a result of our improvement efforts or other changes in our practice. If we spot shifts and trends, we should be asking ‘what is happening here? Why do we see this significant change?’ If it is due to our improvement efforts, praise is definitely due!  



**How process limits are calculated** 

The process limits are calculated at 3 sigma above and below the mean.  Sigma is similar to standard deviation, but it is not the same.  The difference is that the standard deviation is a single number which gives you the average dispersion of an entire data set, whereas the control limits (sigma limits) are boundaries of a process that keeps changing over time. Therefore the limits change over time. Means and process limits recalculate either after there is a sustained shift in the process of 12 or more points above or below the mean OR every 6 months to reflect a more up-to-date process.
