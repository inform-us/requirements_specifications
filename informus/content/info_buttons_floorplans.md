## Pain scores floorplan 

## i button


 
Good pain management is an essential component of quality care. Pain in critical care and post-anaesthetic care unit is common and contributes to poor patient outcomes.  

In CCU we assess pain using the Verbal Pain Scale (VPS) or Critical Care Observation Tool (CPOT) for patients who are unable to self-report their pain, e.g. under sedation.  

Pain assessment as per the critical care pain guidelines: 

* Assess 4-hourly for no/mild pain 

* Asses hourly for moderate/severe pain
  
* Reassess pain after interventions 

* If pain is difficult to manage ask for help and refer patient to the pain team 

* If patient is sleeping, but seems comfortable, you can select ‘unable to assess’ and write the reason. Sleep should be the only reason for selecting that pain is ‘unable to assess’.

## ? button


**Eligibility**  

All patients 


**Classification**


* **Green:** Patient’s most recent pain score indicates none or mild pain (VPS = 0-1 or CPOT= 0-2) 

* **Amber:** Patient’s most recent pain score indicates moderate pain (VPS = 2 or CPOT= 3-4) 

* **Red:** Patient’s most recent pain score indicates severe or very severe pain (VPS = 3-4 or CPOT= 5-8) 

Amber and red scores are valid for 60 minutes (plus 15 minutes documentation leeway) or until a new score is documented. 

Green pain scores valid for 4 hours (plus 15 minutes documentation leeway) or until a new score is documented. 

These data update every five minutes.  


* **Tip 1:** If there has been more than one pain score documented across one hour, the most recent score will be used unless a) the most recent score was CPOT preceded by a VPS score, in which case the most recent VPS score will be use or b) the most recent score was VPS 'unable to assess' preceded by a VPS or CPOT, in which case the most recent VPS or CPOT will be used. This allows the dashboard to show the most recent pain score, which may have changed following an intervention.  

* **Tip 2:** If more than one score is documented at the same time, the highest score will be used. If the scores are equal, VPS will be used in preference to CPOT.  

* **Tip 3:** If a bed is dark grey, calculation cannot be completed 

* **Tip 4:**  Pain assessments recorded as “unable to assess” due to sleep will not show on the individual patient graph as this is not a pain score. 

* **Tip 5:**  A gap after a blue line on the individual patient charts reflects the 15-minute leeway added to the validity window of a score

**Page: Clinical dashboard tab: Target tile**

## All targets set in ICU navigators floorplan 

## i button

Physiological targets are set to facilitate the bedside nurse titrating therapy.

There is varying degree of harm when physiological variables are persistently out of range.

Targets should be discussed in handover each morning and set in targets tab of ICU Navigators of EPIC before 13:00 hours (and after 08:00 hours).

If you are unsure about a patient's target, ask the doctor in charge for guidance during handover.

Our nurses rely on these targets to deliver safe, quality care.

## ? button


**Eligibility**  

All patients on ICU - 'All patients in critical care'.


**Classification**


**Rule 1:** All eight physiological targets completed in the ICU Targets section of the ICU Navigators.

**Rule 2:** Compliance measured at 13:00 hours each day.


**Tip 1:** All targets ideally set at the same entry at the morning handover or on admission. 

**Tip 2:** If a target is not applicable, please select 'Not applicable'.

**Tip2:** Targets refresh at 08:00 each day. Do not set targets before 08:00 or they will be counted as set from the previous day.

**Page: Clinical dashboard tab: SpO2 Saturations**

## SpO2 targets achieved floorplan

## i button

Oxygen therapy is prescribed to achieve a specific target SpO2 range, most commonly 94-98% or 88-92%. A bespoke range can be set if required.

Note that SpO2 targets have an upper as well as lower limit.

Elevated blood oxygen levels are associated with poor outcomes. Decreased blood oxygen levels are also associated with poor outcomes and less physiological reserve in the event of sudden deterioration.

If you are unsure about a patient’s SpO2 target, ask the doctor in charge for guidance during handover.



## ? button


**Eligibility**  

Patients are receiving supplemental oxygen. If a patient does not receive supplemental oxygen for four consecutive hours, they are classified as ‘Not on oxygen therapy’.


**Classification**


**In range:** Within target range.

**Above:** Patient has been above range for three consecutive hours OR five non-consecutive hours within the preceding 24 hours.

**Below:** Patient has been below range for two consecutive hours OR five non-consecutive hours within the preceding 24 hours.


**Tip 1:** These data update on the hour.

**Tip 2:** Non-numerical means that a free text target has been set.

**Tip 3:**  If a bed is dark grey, calculation cannot be completed.

**Page: Clinical dashboard tab: Mean Arteriel BP**

## Mean Arteriel Blood Pressure (MAP) achieved

## i button


Excessive use of intravenous vasoactive drugs is associated with poor outcomes. Conversely, low blood pressure is also associated with poor outcome.

MAP targets have an upper as well as lower limit. We need to ensure the MAP remains within the target range and not above or below for prolonged periods.

If you are unsure about a patient’s MAP target, ask the doctor in charge for guidance during handover.


## ? button



**Eligibility**

Patients are receiving intravenous vasoactive drugs. If a patient does not receive this medication for four consecutive hours, they are classified as ‘not on intravenous vasoactive drugs’.


**Classification**


**In range:** Within target range.

**Above:** Patient has been above range for three consecutive hours OR five non-consecutive hours within the preceding 24 hours.

**Below:** Patient has been below range for two consecutive hours OR five non-consecutive hours within the preceding 24 hours.



**Tip 1:** These data update on the hour.

**Tip 2:**  Non numerical means that a free text target has been set.

**Tip 3:**  If a bed is dark grey, calculation cannot be completed.

**Page: Clinical dashboard tab: RASS**

## RASS Targets achieved

## i button

The Richmond Agitation and Sedation Score (RASS) measures how sedated or agitated a patient is and is used to prevent over- or under- sedation.

Excessive use of sedative drugs to support mechanical ventilation is associated with poor outcomes. To prevent this we set an optimal RASS target, balancing safety and comfort.

If you are unsure about a patient’s RASS target, ask the doctor in charge for guidance during handover.



## ? button


**Eligibility**  

Patients are receiving sedative drugs, intubated and mechanically ventilated. If a patient is not sedated and mechanically ventilated for four consecutive hours, they are classified as ‘not sedated & mechanically ventilated’.



**Classification**

RASS score is valid for 4 hours.

**Achieving target:** Patient’s most recent RASS reading is the same as the target set.

**Not achieving target:** Patient’s most recent RASS reading differs from the target set.



**Tip 1:** These data update on the hour.

**Tip 2:** Non-numerical means that a free text target has been set.

**Tip 3:** If a bed is dark grey, calculation cannot be completed. 

**Tip 4:** RASS score is valid for four hours or until a new score is documented.

**Page: Clinical dashboard tab: Tidal Volume**

## Tidal Volume targets achieved (below 8ml/kg IBW)

## i button


Tidal volume measures the size of each breath given by the ventilator to the patient. High tidal volumes during mandatory ventilation (in particular acute lung injury) are associated with increased morbidity and mortality.

The evidence for lung protective ventilation supports maintaining a tidal volume of 6-8 ml/kg Ideal Body Weight (IBW) in patients who are on mandatory ventilation.

Persistently exceeding 8ml/kg worsens outcome through pulmonary complications and their systemic consequences, both in medical and post-operative patients.

Conversely, tidal volumes less than 6ml/kg are not associated with similar harm.

Tidal volume targets do not need to be set. All eligible patients must have a height documented in EPIC (to calculate IBW) and should be kept within 6-8 ml/kg IBW.



## ? button


**Eligibility**  

Patients are intubated (oral/nasal tube or tracheostomy) and on mandatory ventilation. If a patient is not on mandatory ventilation for four consecutive hours, they are classified as ‘not on mandatory ventilation’.




**Classification**


**In range:** Tidal volumes are less than 8 ml/kg IBW and have not met ‘above range’ criteria.

**Above range:** Tidal volumes are above 8ml/kg IBW for 3 consecutive hours OR 5 non-consecutive hours within the preceding 24 hours; OR tidal volumes are above 10 ml/kg IBW for 2 consecutive hours.


**Tip 1:** These data update on the hour

**Page: Clinical dashboard tab: CAM-ICU**

## CAM-ICU delirium floorplan 

## i button


Delirium is an acute confusional state that may not always be easy to recognise, but is harmful to patients and staff. To assess whether delirium is present, CAM-ICU scores should be completed alongside RASS for patients with a RASS score of -3 and above (i.e. not heavily sedated) once a shift or if a person's mental state changes.  

Recognisation and documentation of delirium enables formulation of a management plan to assess causes and treat them. 

## ? button


**Eligibility** 

All patients who have a valid RASS score between -3 to +4 this shift

**Classification**

For eligible patients (RASS -3 to +4), the CAM-ICU metric should be documented once per 12-hour shift.  Every CAM-ICU score set on a shift is valid until the end of the shift or until superseded by a subsequent documented score.  Therefore, the CAM-ICU score will expire at 07.59 or 19.59 every day.

If a patient’s most recent CAM-ICU score is positive: delirium is present.   

If a patient’s most recent CAM-ICU score is negative: delirium is not present.


**Tip 1:** If there has been more than one CAM-ICU score documented across a shift, the most recent score will be used. 

**Tip 2:** Only patients that meet RASS criteria (i.e. have RASS score between -3 and 4) are included in percentage calculations on the front tile.

**Tip3:** RASS scores are valid for 1 hour during the day (06:00 - 21:59) and 4 hour during the night (22:00 to 05.59). If a patient has a valid CAM-ICU score, but not a valid RASS score this will be denoted by a dashed line around a coloured (red or green) bed.

**Tip4:** A blue shaded bed indicates that the patient's RASS score is below -3 and therefore a CAM-ICU is not required.

## All POM patients DrEaMing floorplan 

## i button

Ensuring that patients Drink, Eat and Mobilise (DrEaMing) as soon as possible after surgery is important for timely recovery and for reducing post-operative complications such as respiratory infections. 
Patients receiving different types of surgery will have different guidelines concerning the initiation of drinking, eating and mobilisation. Therefore, when viewing and interpreting this floorplan, knowledge of individual patients' recovery pathway is required.

## ? button

**Eligibility** 

All patients on T06 or WMS

**Classification**

Fluid intake, diet intake and mobilisation achieved metrics should be documented once every 24 hours or until the patient's status changes.  
Fluid intake, diet intake and mobilisation achieved metrics are valid for 24 hours from 00:01 hours each day or until a new entry is made.
For compliance with documentation to be achieved, a patient must have all three metrics documented within the 24-hour period.

## All patients Airway Plan Completed 

## i button

Airway managment in critical care can be seen as a routine procedure for critically ill patients. Neverorless, critical care patients are more prone to complications from airway management procedures which may result in worse patient outcomes (such as death, brain damage and prolonged ICU stay).   

Identification of patients with difficult airways enables an individualised airway plan to be formulated. Such a plan includes ensuring that adequately trained personale and appropriate equipment are accessible in an airway emergency.  

## ? button

**Eligibility** 

All patients accross all units

**Classification**

**MISSING:** There has been no airway plan completed during this admission. 

**COMPLETED:** An ICU Airway plan has been completed during this admission. 

**FOR REVIEW:** An ICU Airway plan has been completed during this admission but over 14 days ago.  Because this patient does not have a natural airway and a DAS generic airway plan it is reccomended that the plan is reviewed in order to ensure that it is still appropriate.   

**UPDATE REQUIRED:** An update to the current airway plan is required as patient has had an new artifical airway inserted.
