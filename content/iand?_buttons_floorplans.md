## Pain scores floorplan 

## i button


 
Good pain management is an essential component of quality care. Pain in critical care and post-anasthetic care unit is common and contributes to poor patient outcomes.  

In CCU we assess pain using the Verbal Pain Scale (VPS) or Critical Care Observation Tool (CPOT) for patients who are unable to self-report their pain, e.g. under sedation.  

Pain assessment as per the critical care pain guidelines: 

* Assess 4-hourly for no/mild pain 

* Asses hourly for moderate/severe pain
  
* Reassess pain after interventions 

* If pain is difficult to manage ask for help and refer patient to the pain team 

* If patient is sleeping, but seems comfortable, you can select ‘unable to assess’ and write the reason. Sleep should be the only reason for selecting that pain is ‘unable to assess’.

**Eligibility**  

All patients 


**Classification**


* **Green:** Patient’s most recent pain score indicates none or mild pain (VPS = 0-1 or CPOT= 0-2) 

* **Amber:** Patient’s most recent pain score indicates moderate pain (VPS = 2 or CPOT= 3-4) 

* **Red:** Patient’s most recent pain score indicates severe or very severe pain (VPS = 3-4 or CPOT= 5-8) 

Amber and red scores are valid for 60 minutes (plus 15 minutes documentation leeway) or until a new score is documented. 

Green pain scores valid for 4 hours (plus 15 minutes documentation leeway) or until a new score is documented. 

These data update every five minutes.  


* **Tip 1:** If there has been more than one pain score documented across one hour, the most recent score will be used unless a) the most recent score was CPOT preceded by a VPS score, in which case the most recent VPS score will be use or b) the most recent score was VPS 'unable to assess' preceded by a VPS or CPOT, in which case the most recent VPS or CPOT will be used. This allows the dashboard to show the most recent pain score, which may have changed following an intervention.  

* **Tip 2:** If more than one score is documented at the same time, the highest score will be used. If the scores are equal, VPS will be used in preference to CPOT.  

* **Tip 3:** If a bed is dark grey, calculation cannot be completed 

* **Tip 4:**  Pain assessments recorded as “unable to assess” due to sleep will not show on the individual patient graph as this is not a pain score. This will appear greyed out (same as missing).  

* **Tip 5:**  A gap after a blue line on the individual patient charts reflects the 15-minute leeway added to the validity window of a score

## All targets set in ICU navigators floorplan 

## i button

Physiological targets are set to facilitate the bedside nurse titrating therapy.

There is varying degree of harm when physiological variables are persistently out of range.

Targets should be discussed in handover each morning and set in targets tab of ICU Navigators of EPIC before 13:00 hours.

If you are unsure about a patient's target, ask the doctor in charge for guidance during handover.

Our nurses rely on these targets to deliver safe, quality care.

## ? button


**Eligibility**  

All patients on ICU - 'All patients in critical care'.


**Classification**


**Rule 1:** All eight physiological targets completed in the ICU Targets section of the ICU Navigators.

**Rule 2:** Compliance measured at 13:00 hours each day.


**Tip 1:** All targets ideally set at the same entry at the morning handover or on admission.

**Tip 2:** If a target is not applicable, please select 'Not applicable'.

**Page: Clinical dashboard tab: SpO2 Saturations**

## SpO2 targets achieved floorplan

## i button

Oxygen therapy is prescribed to achieve a specific target SpO2 range, most commonly 94-98% or 88-92%. A bespoke range can be set if required.

Note that SpO2 targets have an upper as well as lower limit.

Elevated blood oxygen levels are associated with poor outcomes. Decreased blood oxygen levels are also associated with poor outcomes and less physiological reserve in the event of sudden deterioration.

If you are unsure about a patient’s SpO2 target, ask the doctor in charge for guidance during handover.



## ? button


**Eligibility**  

Patients are receiving supplemental oxygen. If a patient does not receive supplemental oxygen for four consecutive hours, they are classified as ‘Not on oxygen therapy’.


**Classification**


**In range:** Within target range.

**Above:** Patient has been above range for three consecutive hours OR five non-consecutive hours within the preceding 24 hours.

**Below:** Patient has been below range for two consecutive hours OR five non-consecutive hours within the preceding 24 hours.


**Tip 1:** These data update on the hour.

**Tip 2:** Non-numerical means that a free text target has been set.

**Tip 3:** Unable to calculate means missing data does not allow classification.

**Page: Clinical dashboard tab: Mean Arteriel BP**

## Mean Arteriel Blood Pressure (MAP) achieved

## i button


Excessive use of intravenous vasoactive drugs is associated with poor outcomes. Conversely, low blood pressure is also associated with poor outcome.

MAP targets have an upper as well as lower limit. We need to ensure the MAP remains within the target range and not above or below for prolonged periods.

If you are unsure about a patient’s MAP target, ask the doctor in charge for guidance during handover.


## ? button



**Eligibility**

Patients are receiving intravenous vasoactive drugs. If a patient does not receive this medication for four consecutive hours, they are classified as ‘not on intravenous vasoactive drugs’.


**Classification**


**In range:** Within target range.

**Above:** Patient has been above range for three consecutive hours OR five non-consecutive hours within the preceding 24 hours.

**Below:** Patient has been below range for two consecutive hours OR five non-consecutive hours within the preceding 24 hours.



**Tip 1:** These data update on the hour.

**Tip 2:**  Non numerical means that a free text target has been set.

**Tip 3:**  Unable to calculate means missing data does not allow classification.

**Page: Clinical dashboard tab: RASS**

## RASS Targets achieved

## i button

The Richmond Agitation and Sedation Score (RASS) measures how sedated or agitated a patient is and is used to prevent over- or under- sedation.

Excessive use of sedative drugs to support mechanical ventilation is associated with poor outcomes. To prevent this we set an optimal RASS target, balancing safety and comfort.

If you are unsure about a patient’s RASS target, ask the doctor in charge for guidance during handover.



## ? button


**Eligibility**  

Patients are receiving sedative drugs, intubated and mechanically ventilated. If a patient is not sedated and mechanically ventilated for four consecutive hours, they are classified as ‘not sedated & mechanically ventilated’.



**Classification**

RASS score is valid for 4 hours.

**Achieving target:** Patient’s most recent RASS reading is the same as the target set.

**Not achieving target:** Patient’s most recent RASS reading differs from the target set.



**Tip 1:** These data update on the hour.

**Tip 2:** Non-numerical means that a free text target has been set.

**Tip 3:** Unable to calculate means missing data does not allow classification.

**Tip 4:** RASS score is valid for four hours or until a new score is documented.

**Page: Clinical dashboard tab: Tidal Volume**

## Tidal Volume targets achieved (below 8ml/kg IBW)

## i button


Tidal volume measures the size of each breath given by the ventilator to the patient. High tidal volumes during mandatory ventilation (in particular acute lung injury) are associated with increased morbidity and mortality.

The evidence for lung protective ventilation supports maintaining a tidal volume of 6-8 ml/kg Ideal Body Weight (IBW) in patients who are on mandatory ventilation.

Persistently exceeding 8ml/kg worsens outcome through pulmonary complications and their systemic consequences, both in medical and post-operative patients.

Conversely, tidal volumes less than 6ml/kg are not associated with similar harm.

Tidal volume targets do not need to be set. All eligible patients must have a height documented in EPIC (to calculate IBW) and should be kept within 6-8 ml/kg IBW.



## ? button


**Eligibility**  

Patients are intubated (oral/nasal tube or tracheostomy) and on mandatory ventilation. If a patient is not on mandatory ventilation for four consecutive hours, they are classified as ‘not on mandatory ventilation’.




**Classification**


**In range:** Tidal volumes are less than 8 ml/kg IBW and have not met ‘above range’ criteria.

**Above range:** Tidal volumes are above 8ml/kg IBW for 3 consecutive hours OR 5 non-consecutive hours within the preceding 24 hours; OR tidal volumes are above 10 ml/kg IBW for 2 consecutive hours.


**Tip 1:** These data update on the hour

**Tip 2:** Unable to calculate means missing data does not allow classification
