## Dashboard display

Both INFORM_us and INFORM_ed need to support the following screen resolutions:

- 2560px x 1440px - this is the resolution on the large touchscreen used across multiple units,
- 1920px x 1080px - this is the resolution on the kiosk machines which are locked down to display only the production deployment,

Desktops, laptops, and some tablets are also supported, but anything lower than a 1280px width is currently not supported.

Both applications are currently only supported on the Chrome browser.
All other browsers should not be expected to work properly.
